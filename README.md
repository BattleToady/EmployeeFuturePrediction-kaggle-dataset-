Task: make EDA and try to build prediction model
target - LeaveOrNot(employee will leave this company in 2 years)
Result: I found some intresting insights, what must be considered, because there are real big imbalance in some offices, for different groups(female, 2-salary level, masters etc.), also built the model, f1 on test set = 76.96, and precision = 77.77. So it isn't bad. Also we can see overfitting so theoretically we can improve this score.

You can look at my work and results here, on github. It's not necessary to lunch it.
